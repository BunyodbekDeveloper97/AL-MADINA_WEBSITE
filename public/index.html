                <h3 data-key="community1">Eid al-Adha (Qurbani)</h3>
                <p data-key="community-1">Eid al-Adha is not just an act of worship but the highest form of drawing closer to Allah 
                    and showing love and compassion. Sacrifice (Qurbani) is an essential part of Islam, bringing Muslims together 
                    and encouraging them to lend a helping hand to those in need. As scholars have said, "The sacrifice is an act of worship 
                    done to seek Allah’s pleasure." (Imam Bukhari)
                    Eid al-Adha symbolizes the unity of Muslims as a community, the practice of charity, and supporting one another in times of hardship. 
                    Every moment of this day is an opportunity to earn Allah's mercy, to have sins forgiven, and to purify the heart. 
                    Sacrificing an animal is not just about giving away material wealth for the sake of Allah but also about helping the poor, sharing joy with relatives, 
                    and striving for the collective good.
                    As Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, "Whoever sacrifices with the intention of pleasing Allah, their sins will be forgiven." Sacrifice is not just about giving away wealth, 
                    but it is also about purifying the soul, controlling the ego, and helping the community.
                    The significance of Eid al-Adha is that it unites Muslims, encourages them to show mercy, love, and compassion, and directs them toward a common goal: seeking Allah's pleasure. 
                    We ask Allah to enable us to perform the sacrifice with sincere intentions and bless all Muslims with unity, peace, and prosperity. May Allah never deprive us of His mercy.

                <h3 data-key="community2">Jumu'ah Prayer</h3>
                <p data-key="community-2">Jumu'ah prayer is not just an act of worship; it is an opportunity for Muslims to draw closer to Allah, 
                   to renew their faith, and to refresh their deeds. As Islamic scholars have said, "The reward of the prayer offered 
                   on Jumu'ah is many times greater than the prayer offered on other days." (Imam Bukhari) Jumu'ah prayer, 
                   as a communal act of worship, unites Muslims, strengthens their bond, and encourages helping one another, 
                   fostering unity and solidarity.
                   As Imam Ghazali said, "Jumu'ah prayer is the greatest blessing that expresses the vitality of Islam and the spirit of community." 
                   The khutbah (sermon) delivered on Jumu'ah not only enriches Muslims with religious knowledge but also provides them with moral guidance. 
                   Every word, every recited verse, and every hadith calls the community toward goodness and righteousness.
                   After performing Jumu'ah prayer, it is important to continue the path shown by the hadith, "Whoever performs Jumu'ah prayer and then remembers Allah, 
                   their heart is purified." Performing Jumu'ah prayer is, for every Muslim, the key to blessings, success, and happiness in this world and the hereafter.
                   We ask Allah to grant us the ability to perform Jumu'ah prayer with sincerity and correct intentions and to strengthen us on the path of righteousness.

                   encouraging the community to follow the path of goodness and righteousness. 
                   Each sermon stands out for its impact and its ability to provide spiritual guidance. 
                   Through the scholarly work and lessons conducted at our mosque, 
                   these scholars play a significant role in nurturing pious and ethical individuals within our society. 
                   We pray to Allah to make their knowledge beneficial for all Muslims and grant them success in serving our community.
