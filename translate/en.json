    "hadis1": "It was narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Envy consumes good deeds just as fire consumes wood, and charity extinguishes bad deeds just as water extinguishes fire. Prayer is the light of the believer and fasting is a shield against the Fire.",
    "hadis2": "On the authority of Abu Harayrah  (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: Allah (mighty and sublime be He) said: Spend (on charity), O son of Adam, and I shall spend on you. It was related  by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim).",
    "hadis3": "It was narrated from 'Adiyy bin Hatim that the Prophet said: << Protect yourselves from the Fire, even with half a date. >>",
    "hadis4": "Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: No one gives Sadaqa of a date out of his honest earning, but Allah accepts it with His Right Hand, and then fosters it as one of you fosters the colt or a young she-camel, till it becomes like a mountain or even greater."
